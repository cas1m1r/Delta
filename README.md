# Delta Debugger 
Trying to create a debugger for reverse engineering. The idea is to create an interactive environment for
engaging with a binary you are trying to reverse. While working on reversing challenges I come 
across functions that are challenging to understand. This is my attempt to kind of unify the decompilation you see in 
tools like Ghidra or IDA, with the patching/inspection one does in a debugger like GDB, to the exploitation and
process hacking in pwntools into one place. 

It might not work at all, or it might be super cool. Either way I am learning a lot about linux internals, assembly and how 
computers actually work so it's worth it.
